# **Angular**

## This project was made with **Angular Reactive Forms Module** and **Angular Material**.

It is a project that shows a list of clients and allow you to edit, delete and even create a new client. All clients are storaged in memory, so when you refresh the page it will lose the new clients you have added.

Here is a few prints for knowing the project:

### 1. First page:

You can see all the mock clients and the buttons to edit, delete and create a client. There is also a paginator that you can set how many clients you want to see per page and the arrow to go next and previous.

If I click on edit icon it navigates to the edit page where you can see many input controls of the form.

### 2. Second Page

The next print shows a blank form and as you can see it is possible to add extra adresses (as many as you want).

It is possible to type the CEP number and it will automatically get address data and fill in the form.

This last print below shows you a example of validation on email field and the save button that is disabled until the form turns valid and also it is possible to see the phone mask.
